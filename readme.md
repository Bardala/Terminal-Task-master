## Project Summary

We are presenting a powerful personal management tool, built with Python and the Command Line Interface, designed to bring organization and efficiency to your daily tasks. Our tool is built on Object-Oriented Programming principles, ensuring robustness and scalability for future enhancements.

Our tool thoughtfully includes features such as todo lists, routine management, and algorithm searching, catering to a wide range of user needs. We have a clear development plan, dedicating each day to a specific aspect of the tool, laying a strong foundation for systematic progress.

The program can be easily initiated with a simple command "bardala", demonstrating our commitment to user-friendliness and accessibility, even for those less tech-savvy. As we move forward, we plan to implement version control with Git and GitHub, enabling effective tracking of changes and collaboration, especially as the project grows to include more contributors.

In conclusion, our project is a well-planned, versatile CLI tool that aims to significantly streamline life management processes for users.

## Parent Idea
We propose the development of a mission framework, a strategic approach to tackle recurring issues effectively. This framework serves as a guide when you encounter problems, directing you on how to deal with them based on past experiences. For instance:

Suppose you're developing a desktop application using Electron.js and React.js and encounter a problem with the react-router-dom library. Instead of immediately seeking a solution, the framework advises you to first evaluate the necessity of routing in your project. If routing is indeed required, only then should you seek a solution or an alternative.
This mission framework not only addresses current issues but also serves as a repository for solutions and observations, streamlining the process for similar future challenges.

The first problem our desktop-app aims to solve is the creation of this mission framework for problem-solving. The second goal is to enrich this framework with your observations and insights.

By systematically documenting the steps taken, the rationale behind decisions, and any observations made during the problem-solving process, the framework evolves into a valuable knowledge base. This knowledge base can then be referenced or adapted for future problems, saving time and resources while promoting consistency in the quality of solutions.

## Key Features

- **Todo Management**: Create a list of tasks with options to add new tasks, view all tasks, delete completed ones, update existing tasks, and mark tasks as completed.
- **Routine Management**: Develop a set of routines for various scenarios, such as routines for when feeling bored or strategies for tackling problems.
- **Algorithm Setting**: Implement algorithms that can help manage time more efficiently and provide methods for dealing with less enjoyable tasks.
- **Thought Logging**: Design a system to record thoughts and ideas, which can be referenced later for personal growth or problem-solving.
- **Problem Solving**: Maintain a journal of problems encountered and the solutions applied, which can serve as a learning tool for future challenges.
- **Planning**: Set up a planning module to outline and track short-term and long-term goals, along with the steps needed to achieve them.
- **Algorithm Searching**: Integrate a search feature to find algorithms that can assist in solving current problems or optimizing tasks.
- **Instructions**: Include a help section with commands that users can input to learn how to use different features of the program.

The demo provides a practical walkthrough of the command-line tool's functionality. The tool is designed to manage various aspects of a user's life, including projects and todos.

In the demo, the user navigates between different modes, such as project mode and todo mode, by entering simple commands. In each mode, the user can perform various actions like adding, listing, and updating items.

The tool also provides a help command in each mode, which displays a list of all available commands, making it user-friendly and easy to navigate.

Moreover, the tool is designed to handle invalid commands gracefully, guiding the user to use the help command to get a list of valid commands.

In summary, this tool serves as a comprehensive personal management system, offering a simple and intuitive command-line interface for managing projects and todos. It's a handy tool for anyone looking to organize their tasks and projects efficiently.
