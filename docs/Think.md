I want to create a project which run in command line and it will be a about my life styles, todos, my daily routines, my goals, my plans, my ideas, my thoughts, my notes, my projects,my hobbies, my interests, my failures, my problems, my solutions, my mistakes, my lessons, my challenges, and I will use python.

The project will run in cmd by typing `py filename.py`.
Once I run the project, I can type any command which I have made to do something, ex:

- when I type `todo`, it will show me my todos.
- when I type `add_todo`, it will add a todo.

The program will have the ability to:

- notify me.
- open other programs.
- set alarms.
- open projects in vscode.
- open websites.
  It will have a lot of permissions to do things in my computer.

# User Stories:

- As a user, I want to add a todo.
- As a user, I want to see my todos.
- As a user, I want to delete a todo.
- As a user, I want to update a todo.
- As a user, I want to make a todo as done.
- As a user, I can write a routine to do when feeling boring, bad, not self-controlled...
- As a user, I can write a routine to do when I face a problem in coding, in life, in work, in study...
- As a user, I can write a routine to do when I face a problem in relationship, in family, in friends, in colleagues...
- As a user, I can write a routine to do when I face a problem in health, in mental, in physical, in emotional...
- As a user, I can set algorithms about how to manage my time.
- As a user, I can set algorithms about how to manage something I don't love to do.
- As a user, I can write my thoughts to benefit myself in the future.
- As a user, I can write ways which I use to solve a specific problem.
- As a user, I can write my plans to do in the future.
- As a user, I can search about algorithms to solve a specific current problem.
- As a user, I can write command to show me the instructions of the program.
